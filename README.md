## Project Report

### Reflection 

For this first iteration, we didn't hit very many issues in what we were working on, so things went mostly smoothly. None of us have ever done an AI, especially for something top-down, so it was an interesting challenge that wasn't difficult to implement. Other than that, there was trouble figuring out how to properly implement a health bar, but it was figured out without causing any issues.

We personally believe that this project/iteration deserves an A, based on the following requirements:
